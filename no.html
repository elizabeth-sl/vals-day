    <h1>Happy Valentine's Day ❤️</h1>
    <div class="letter">
        <p>Baeeeeeee,</p>
        <p>(Apparently, there's nothing like 'no,' since a certain someone said we're locked in. Besides, why would you even want to say 'no' duhhh🙄)</p> 
        <p>You're my safe space, my happiness, and the best thing that has ever happened to me. You make me feel cherished, understood, and so deeply loved in a way I never thought possible. I know it gets hard with the distance and my terrible mood swings but just know I'm sooooo grateful to have you and to call you mine😌.</p>
        <p>I know this isn't much, but I'll do better next time okayyy😔. I'm trying my best to be a better girlfriend, just don't get tired of me okayy.. and if there's anyway I'm lacking just tell me okayyy. I know there's not much I can do for you and I can't promise you the world (obviously), but I promise you all of me. I'm all yours and I've always got your back, no matter what. I love you ml❤️</p>
        <p>PS: I didn't know what to get you since you already have that bracelet thingy, I mean the package I showed you, and you're soooooo far away so ermm I decided on CP. I don't know if it's enough tho. Wanted to order flowers for you heheee but then all the sites I came across were telling me error (the audacity😔 I've prayed for their businesses to collapse tho😌)</p>
        <p>Every day with you is special, but today, I just want to remind you that you are loved beyond words. You're stuck with me forever, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

        <p>Guess I'm doneeeeee. Go back and tap yes. I've flowers for youuuuu🤭. Hope to see you soon😔🫂</p>
        <p class="signature">Your loveeeee, <br> Saamaa ❤️</p>
